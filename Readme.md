The only argument is the list of points as a list/tuple of lists/tuples, as the following format:
[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3),...]

Example:
`area_of_convex_polygon( [(0,0), (4,0), (4,4), (0,4)] )`

It is written by Python 3.

You can test it by running the following command:
`python test.py`
